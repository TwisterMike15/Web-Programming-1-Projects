<h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
<p>I am dual majoring in Computer Science and Computer Information systems. I have been programming for 6 years now, and have developed many applications.
<br>The first time I wrote a program was in a high school robotics class. Ever sicne the time I wrote my first program, I knew that I loved programming.
<br>After realizing how much I loved programming, I decided to go to Steel Center for Career and Technical Education, a vo-tech school for high school students,
<br>for Computer Information Systems. There a learned a lot about hardware, software, and troubleshooting, among other similar skills. After attending to Steel
<br>Center, I quickly realized that I wanted to persue Computer Science as a career. Because of this, I decided to attend California Unvierity of Pennsylvannia,
<br>where I am currenlty dual majoring in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems.
<br>
<br>I have been attending California University for 4 years now, and am anticipating graduating from my undergraduate studies in Spring 2021. At California
<br>Univerisy I have been involved in some key projects that have been beneficial to the University as a whole. One of these was the development for a web
<br>application implemented at the Strike a Spark Conference in April of 2019. Additionally, I am currently working on developing a bus tracking system,
<br>known as the "Vulcan Transit Tracker", for the Vulcan Fliers on campus. Finally, I have been conducting undergraduate research into ways to reduce
<br>the State Space Explosion Problem in Model Checking. Up to this point, I have achieve a great deal as a Computer Scientist, and I believe that my skills
<br>will be beneficial to your compnay or university.</p>
