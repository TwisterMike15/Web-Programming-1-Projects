<h2>General Research Interests:</h2>
<p>I am generally interested in conducting research in Computer Sciecne. More specifically I am very intrigued in doing research into these areas of Computer Science: Automoata Theory, Software Engineering, Model Checking, Artificial Intellegence, Networking, Cryptograpy, and Concurrency.

<h3>Current Research:</h3>
<p>I am currently studying a subfield of Software Verification. Software Verification is an area of study in Computer Science that attempts reduce the likelihood of errors in programs
   and to ensure that programs perform all expected requirements. Model Checking is a form of Software Verification that utilizes Automata Theory, which is a theory commonly used by
    Computer Scientists and Software Engineers to represent a software or hardware system that is being designed. However, there is a large problem in the area of Model Checking known
     as the State Space Explosion Problem. The State Space Explosion Problem is an issue caused when programs grow in complexity. As a program gets increasingly complex,
     it becomes increasingly difficult to use Model Checking to verify programs. My goal with this project is to discover a new way to reduce the State Space Explosion Problem,
     add to existing research into ways to reduce the State Space Explosion Problem, or to create a formal proof to prove that an existing way of reducing the State Space Explosion
     Problem is accurate.</p>
